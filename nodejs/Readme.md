<h1>Node.js Examples</h1>
<h4>Feed Muncher</h4>
Pretty much a standalone jQuery + Bootstrap web app that is multi-device friendly. However, hosting this in node.js to understand different ways to delivering content.

Works on a set of RSS feeds hardcoded into the Javascript. Fetches random feed on page load and on 'Random' button click.

Future Enhancements:
1. A way to personalize the feed set.
2. More bootstrap styling!
3. Fetching and displaying more than 9 feeds but retaining the ability to flip between the set of 9 feeds. Sort of like the Smartphone home screens.
